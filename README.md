# Orbital - TCM - TrackTogether

Team TCM's Orbital 2022 Project: **_TrackTogether_**

## Motivation

In this day and age, it is increasingly difficult to dovetail our personal needs and the common activities among us nicely without conflicts. More often than not, our personal demands are already taxing enough, and it would be double whammy if extra undue effort has to be delegated to liaising with various parties. This spurs the idea of providing a shared platform which is not only capable of alleviating our personal burden by simplifying and automating some of our daily tasks, but also capable of seamlessly integrating both the personal and collaborative aspects of our lives.

Our focus will be pivoted on the finance aspects of our lives, which is motivated by the constant need for us to keep track of our own budget and expenses. This becomes increasingly important and pertinent for teenagers who are stepping into adulthood. Despite having many applications in the market that help us manage our finances, they require manual keying of information from the users. This might defeat the purpose, if say, the user was too bore down with their other commitments such that he/she forgot to key in right after committing the expense and end up having to do extra work to sieve through past transactions to retrieve the required information. Therefore, it will be beneficial to have a personal expense tracker that is linked to the user's bank account and could automatically and instantly extract the corresponding transaction information into the correct expense category.

Additionally, to facilitate a smoother and simpler monetary dealings for most of our daily group activities, it is beneficial to document a transparent, authentic and immutable ledger of transaction records among different parties across events of similar nature, which will then be aggregated into the correct total amount each party should pay or receive when the time is right or when there is a need. This could help to reduce the need for excessively frequent payments and also prevent people from conveniently forgetting about collecting and returning money. Furthermore, the reliance on mobile payments such as PayNow/PayLah poses a challenge for the personal tracker to categorise these types of mutual transactions. The group tracker could therefore complement the flaw of the personal tracker by being able to keep track of the category of group payments and weave them seamlessly into our individual transactions.

## Vision

We envision TrackTogether as a user-friendly automated expense tracker that **abstracts away from users the undue hassle for constant manual tracking** and **empower users to better manage their finance-related activities at both an individual and group level**.
